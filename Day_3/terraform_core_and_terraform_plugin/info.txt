<h1> What is terraform? </h1>

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp, designed to automate the provisioning and 
management of infrastructure across various cloud providers and services. It allows users to define their infrastructure requirements 
in a declarative configuration language, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments.


How Terraform Works????

* Core Components

Terraform operates through two main components:
Terraform Core: This is the central part of Terraform that manages the lifecycle of infrastructure. It reads user-defined configurations, 
compares them to the current state of the infrastructure, and determines the necessary actions to achieve the desired state. This process
 involves creating, updating, or deleting resources as needed.

Terraform Providers: Providers are plugins that enable Terraform to interact with various infrastructure platforms, such as AWS, Azure, or
 Kubernetes. Each provider exposes a set of resources and data sources that Terraform can manage. Providers communicate with Terraform Core
  via Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), allowing Terraform to automate tasks across different services seamlessly.
Workflow Steps

A typical Terraform workflow consists of the following steps:
Write: Users define their infrastructure as code using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). This includes specifying resources, their 
configurations, and dependencies.

Plan: Terraform generates an execution plan by comparing the desired state (as defined in the configuration files) with the current state 
of the infrastructure. This plan outlines the changes that will be made, such as adding or removing resources.

Apply: After reviewing the plan, users can apply the changes. Terraform executes the necessary actions to align the actual infrastructure
with the desired configuration.


State Management
Terraform maintains a state file that represents the current state of the infrastructure. This state file is crucial for tracking resource 
changes and managing dependencies. It allows Terraform to understand what resources exist and how they relate to one another, enabling accurate 
planning and execution of changes.


Multi-Cloud and Custom Deployments One of Terraform's key advantages is its ability to manage resources across multiple cloud providers 
simultaneously. This capability allows teams to use a single tool and language to provision and manage infrastructure, regardless of the
 underlying platform. Additionally, users can create custom providers to integrate with internal tools or other APIs, further extending 
 Terraform's functionality.

 
In summary, Terraform simplifies infrastructure management by allowing users to define their environments as code, automating the provisioning
 process, and providing a consistent approach to managing resources across various platforms.
